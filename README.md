# Pytorch Learning - CNN
## Lectured by Deeplizard at 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4UJ26WkceqONNF5S26OiVw' on February 2020
> Some adaptations implemented on the network class because of future works.

## Description
The dataset is the Fashion MNIST, a dataset of clothing itens provided by a big dept store from Germany to be used as a replacement of classical number MNIST dataset.

The main objective is to classify images of clothing items.
During the course Deeplizard teaches step by step how to build the network its convolutions, experiment runner, and metrics annotator and visualization. Summarized and altered for future works on [fashion-mnist.ipynb]('./fashion-mnist.ipynb').

There are tensor-* jupyter notebooks as well, they were for tensor definitions, operations, and comprehensions of how tensor data structure works, and how may we use it.

Very informative and interesting, thanks Deeplizard.
